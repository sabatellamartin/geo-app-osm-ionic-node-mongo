# GeoApp 

GeoApp is an application to report the location in real time in a hierarchical way. It is able to keep track of the location and notify or report events.

This project is built with Ionic, Node and Mongo technology. The deployment of the application is done with Docker Compose.

It uses OpenStreetMaps as a base layer and on top of this OpenLayers is used to draw features to trace routes and show directions.

I am grateful to the creaator of the project node-express-mongodb-jwt-rest-api-skeleton that I take as a base to carry out the backend in Node

I hope it can help as an example for what you are developing, feel free to use what you need for your own project.

## Resume requieriments

- Allow to work in the application without coverage.
- Possibility of synchronizing any information when there is coverage.
- The system defines 3 roles that correspond to: patrol, operations and general.
- Operations can report incidents and observations
- Patrol will be able to see its own information, the operations of all its patrols and the general all the information.
- Being able to send images by messaging or attached to the report.
